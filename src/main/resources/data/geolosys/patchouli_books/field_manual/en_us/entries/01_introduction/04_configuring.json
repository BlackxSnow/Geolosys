You can make a datapack to create, overwrite or flat-out remove existing Plutons, and this means there's built-in CraftTweaker compatibility! You can still use the (now deprecated) configurator found $(l:https://config.geolosys.com)here$(/l), but in general you should use Data Packs where possible."
